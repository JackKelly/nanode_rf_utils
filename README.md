AVR library for communicating wirelessly using an RFM12b module.
This library is primarily intended to be used by my rfm_edf_ecomanger code
and my emon_tx code.

## USAGE

### Arduino IDE
* Clone this repository in your  `~/sketchbook/libraries/` directory
* That's it!

### Eclipse
* Set this up as an "AVR Cross Target Static Library" as per the "ArduinoCore" section in
[these instructions](http://horrorcoding.altervista.org/arduino-development-with-eclipse-a-step-by-step-tutorial-to-the-basic-setup/)
